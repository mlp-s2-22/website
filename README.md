# Machine Learning In Python (21-22)

This course intends to provide an introduction to machine learning techniques. The course includes discussion on the theory and ideas behind various modern algorithms, so basic knowledge of probability and statistics is required. This is also a focus on practical experience of using suitable toolkits, available in Python, on various datasets.

There is a high demand for computational modellers and data scientists and this course aims to teach skills suitable for careers in a wide range of public and private institutions.

## Course Components
### Weekly Structure
- __Monday:__ Lecture videos and workshop material for the week released
- __Wednesday:__ Previous weeks workshop assignment to be submitted
- __Friday:__ Weekly workshops

### Lecture Materials
These are released on Mondays and are comprised of course content and weekly "State of the MLP" videos (recap of previous week, what’s coming in the new week, frequently asked questions). You're expected to watch (and learn from) them before Friday’s workshops. These will be accomanied by lecture notes created to complement the video lectures and slides.

### Exercises
To keep your learning active, you’ll have the chance to work on exercises associated with that weeks lectures. These exercises will not count towards the final mark, but students are strongly encouraged to complete as many exercises as possible, as they provide examples of the types of questions that may appear on the exam.  For any questions, please attend office hours or post on Piazza.

### Student hours
The weeks lecturer will each hold student hours on __[INSERT DATE/TIME]__. These will be __[in person at INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom and will not be recorded?]__. It's a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!

### Workshops
Workshops will be held on Fridays __[INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom, and they will not be recorded?]__. We expect that you show up to the workshop session you've been assigned to weekly, if you have a scheduling conflict you must officially change your enrolled section.

The four session times are:
– __[TIME]__
– __[TIME]__
– __[TIME]__
– __[TIME]__

During these sessions you will work individually or in small teams (max 4 students) on provided worksheets delivered in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks will provide a number of examples and exercises on practical machine learning in Python.

If you are looking for your workshop times for this course, these can be found via your University of Edinburgh calendar (links provided below):

- [Information about Student Timetables](https://edin.ac/student-timetables)

__Tip:__ Read or even start the workshop materials before the workshop on Friday so you have chance to become familiar with that weeks tasks. This will mean you have more time in the workshop to ask questions to the tutors/lecturers and discuss problems with other students.

## Assessments

Your overall course grade will be comprised of the following components, and their weights:

- Weekly Workshops: 10%
- Project 1: 20%
- Project 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 50%

### Workshop Assessment
Teams are required to to turn in the completed worksheets via __[Gradescope/GitHub repositories?]__ by Wednesday 5pm UK time before the next week’s workshop. Marking will be binary, with any reasonable attempt to complete the worksheet receiving full credit. No extensions will be granted for submitting these worksheets. Solutions will be provided after the deadline.

### Projects
Either individually or as a team of up to 4 students, you will be responsible for the completion of two projects for this course. The goal of these projects is to develop understandable and validated models using the tools and techniques covered in this class. Along with reproducible code, you will be required to submit a report to communicate your research.

Late submissions will be accepted up to seven calendar days of the deadline, with a late submission penalty applied of 5% of the overall mark for each 24 hours past the deadline. Full details on the [extensions and late submissions policy](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/extensions).

Additional specific details on each project will be made availble as the course progresses. 

## Course Policies

### Collaboration
Assigned teamwork should be completed collaboratively. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each project assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.

### Sharing/Reusing Code
There is a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless explicitly told not to use something the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

### Academic Integrity
The University takes academic misconduct very seriously and is committed to ensuring that so far as possible it is detected and dealt with appropriately. Find out more about the University’s official policies around academic misconduct [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/academic-misconduct).

Cheating or plagiarising on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the University policies, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the School Academic Misconduct Office.

### Late Work, Extensions, and Special Circumstances
All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow us (the course staff) to return marks and feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time.

__Late Work:__ Workshops cannot be turned in late but late projects are accepted up to 7 days after the deadline, with 5% penalty for each day. Please review the official University and School policies [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/extensions). If you intend to submit work late for the projects, you __must notify the course organizer before the original deadline__ as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted.

__Extensions:__ The University has an extension policy whereby you can request an extension for any assignments where late work is accepted. If your extension request is approved, you can turn in the assignment late and not incur the late penalty. As outlined above you can request an extension for the projects but extensions are not granted for workshop assignments under any circumstances. To request an extension you must visit the [Extensions and Special Circumstances website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/continuing-students/extensions-explained) and _apply for an extension_ there. A decision will be made within 2 days and the team will notify you (the student) of their decision. Decisions are made by an external committee, not the course teaching staff, so requests for extensions must go through this form and not through course organisers and tutors. It is however useful to inform the course organiser you are applying for an extension and keep them upto date on the progress of your extension request.

__Special Circumstances:__ You can think of special circumstances as one level above an extension request, where there is a documented reason why you're unable to complete any assignment in the course. Special circumstances decisions are made at the end of the semester by an external committee. To request a special circumstances waiver you must visit the [Extensions and Special Circumstances website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/continuing-students/extensions-explained) and _apply for special circumstances_ there.

If you’re not sure whether your personal circumstance should be filed under an extension or special circumstances, we recommend you reach out to your Personal Tutor and/or Student Support Officers (studentsupport@maths.ed.ac.uk).

### Regrade Requests
Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up and submitted via email to David Elliott (david.elliott@ed.ac.uk). These will be honoured if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after [INSERT DATE].

### Diversity & inclusion
It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We wish to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official University of Edinburgh records, please let us know!
- Please let us know your preferred pronouns.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with course staff. We want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your personal tutor is an excellent resource.
- All of us (staff and students alike) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class by anyone that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to the course organiser about it.
