# Machine Learning In Python (21-22)

This course intends to provide an introduction to machine learning techniques. The course includes discussion on the theory and ideas behind various modern algorithms, so basic knowledge of probability and statistics is required. This is also a focus on practical experience of using suitable toolkits, available in Python, on various datasets.

There is a high demand for computational modellers and data scientists and this course aims to teach skills suitable for careers in a wide range of public and private institutions.

## Course Components
### Weekly structure
- __Monday:__ Lecture videos for the week released
- __Wednesday:__ Workshop assignment to be submitted
- __Friday:__ Workshops

### Lecture Materials
These are released on Mondays and are comprised of course content and weekly "State of the MLP" videos (recap of previous week, what’s coming in the new week, frequently asked questions). You're expected to watch (and learn from) them before Friday’s workshops. These will be accomanied by lecture notes created to complement the video lectures and slides.

### Exercises
To keep your learning active, you’ll have the chance to work on exercises associated with that weeks lectures. These exercises will not count towards the final mark, but students are strongly encouraged to complete as many exercises as possible, as they provide examples of the types of questions that may appear on the exam.  For any questions, please attend office hours or post on Piazza.

### Student hours
The weeks lecturer will each hold student hours on [TODO: INSERT DATE/TIME]. These will be [in person/on Zoom and will not be recorded?]. It's a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!

### Workshops
These will be held on Fridays [INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom, and they will not be recorded?]. We expect that you show up to the workshop session you've been assigned to weekly. During these sessions you will work individually or in small teams (max 4 students) on provided worksheets delivered in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks will provide a number of examples and exercises on practical machine learning in Python. Teams are required to to turn in the completed worksheets via [Gradescope/GitHub repositories?] by Wednesday 5pm UK time before the next week’s workshop. Marking will be binary, with any reasonable attempt to complete the worksheet receiving full credit. No extensions will be granted for submitting these worksheets. Solutions will be provided after the deadline.

__Tip:__ Start the workshop materials before the workshop on Friday so you have chance to become familiar with that weeks tasks. This will mean you can use the time in the workshop to ask questions to the tutors/lecturers and discuss problems with other students.
