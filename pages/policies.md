### Collaboration

Assigned teamwork should be completed collaboratively. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each project assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark. While different team members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.

### Sharing/Reusing Code

There is a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless explicitly told not to use something the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

### Academic Integrity

The University takes academic misconduct very seriously and is committed to ensuring that so far as possible it is detected and dealt with appropriately. Find out more about the University’s official policies around academic misconduct [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/academic-misconduct).

Cheating or plagiarising on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the University policies, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the School Academic Misconduct Office.

### Late Work, Extensions, and Special Circumstances

All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow us (the course staff) to return marks and feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time.

__Late Work:__ Workshops cannot be turned in late but late projects are accepted up to 7 days after the deadline, with 5% penalty for each day. Please review the official University and School policies [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/extensions). If you intend to submit work late for the projects, you __must notify the course organizer before the original deadline__ as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted.

__Extensions:__ The University has an extension policy whereby you can request an extension for any assignments where late work is accepted. If your extension request is approved, you can turn in the assignment late and not incur the late penalty. As outlined above you can request an extension for the projects but extensions are not granted for workshop assignments under any circumstances. To request an extension you must visit the [Extensions and Special Circumstances website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/continuing-students/extensions-explained) and _apply for an extension_ there. A decision will be made within 2 days and the team will notify you (the student) of their decision. Decisions are made by an external committee, not the course teaching staff, so requests for extensions must go through this form and not through course organisers and tutors. It is however useful to inform the course organiser you are applying for an extension and keep them upto date on the progress of your extension request.

__Special Circumstances:__ You can think of special circumstances as one level above an extension request, where there is a documented reason why you're unable to complete any assignment in the course. Special circumstances decisions are made at the end of the semester by an external committee. To request a special circumstances waiver you must visit the [Extensions and Special Circumstances website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/continuing-students/extensions-explained) and _apply for special circumstances_ there.

If you’re not sure whether your personal circumstance should be filed under an extension or special circumstances, we recommend you reach out to your Personal Tutor and/or Student Support Officers (studentsupport@maths.ed.ac.uk).

### Regrade Requests

Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up and submitted via email to David Elliott. These will be honoured if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after [INSERT DATE].

### Diversity & inclusion

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We wish to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official University of Edinburgh records, please let us know!
- Please let us know your preferred pronouns.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with course staff. We want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your personal tutor is an excellent resource.
- All of us (staff and students alike) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class by anyone that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to the course organiser about it.
