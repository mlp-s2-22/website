_My pronouns are he/him._

I am a University Teacher in Mathematical Sciences Computing in the School of Mathematics. My work focuses on teaching probability, statistics, and data science to undergraduate and masterâ€™s students; with previous experience teaching hypothesis testing and research design. My recent research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to improve the diagnosis speed and accuracy of identifying seizures in clinical records of electrical brain activity. Alike to many data scientists from a neuroscience background, I appreciate how human neurology and behaviour has inspired many modern machine learning advancements. I am passionate about the practical applications of machine learning and aim to educate and inspire others to develop research and models to tackle real-world challenges.
