### Weekly Structure

- __Monday:__ Lecture videos/slides, exercises, and workshop materials for the week released
- __Wednesday:__ Previous weeks workshop assignment to be submitted
- __Friday:__ Weekly workshops
- __???:__ Student Hours

### Student hours

The weeks lecturer will each hold student hours on __[INSERT DATE/TIME]__. These will be __[in person at INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom and will not be recorded?]__. It's a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!

### Lecture Materials

These are released on Mondays and are comprised of course content and weekly "State of the MLP" videos (recap of previous week, what’s coming in the new week, frequently asked questions). You're expected to watch (and learn from) them before Friday’s workshops. These will be accomanied by lecture notes created to complement the video lectures and slides.

### Exercises

To keep your learning active, you’ll have the chance to work on exercises associated with that weeks lectures. These exercises will not count towards the final mark, but students are strongly encouraged to complete as many exercises as possible, as they provide examples of the types of questions that may appear on the exam.  For any questions, please attend student hours or post on Piazza.

### Workshops

Workshops will be held on Fridays __[INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom, and they will not be recorded?]__. We expect that you show up to the workshop session you've been assigned to weekly, if you have a scheduling conflict you must officially change your enrolled section.

The four session times are:

- __time__
- __time__
- __time__
- __time__

During these sessions you will work individually or in small teams (max 4 students) on provided worksheets delivered in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks will provide a number of examples and exercises on practical machine learning in Python.

If you are looking for your workshop times for this course, these can be found via your University of Edinburgh calendar (links provided below):

__Tip:__ Read or even start the workshop materials before the workshop on Friday so you have chance to become familiar with that weeks tasks. This will mean you have more time in the workshop to ask questions to the tutors/lecturers and discuss problems with other students.

#### Access to Materials
Workshop materials will be released on [Github](https://github.com/mlp-s2-22) each week. Each team will have their own repository that they can use to "push" and "pull" their work. For example your repository for the first workshop will be something like "w01-workshop-teamname". The default is that you individually on your own repositories with your teamname being your github username. However, if you wish to submit work as a team for future workshops (by sharing a repository), please fill out [this form](example.com), and I will can make sure you all are able to work together on the worksheets.

#### Cloud Setup
We recommend the use of Google Colab as a cloud environment for running, working, and submitting code for this course. This is because it...

- Guarentees space to hold the datasets we will use in this course in RAM memory.
- Allows the use of GPU's for Deep Learning models.
- Provides working environment with packages already set up for you.

To set this up:

1. Navigate to [http://colab.research.google.com/github](http://colab.research.google.com/github).
2. Click the "Include Private Repos" checkbox.
3. In the popup window, sign-in to your Github account.
4. Make sure "mlp-s2-22" has a green tick next to it under "Organization access" (otherwise request access) and then authorize Colab to read the private files.
5. Your private repositories and notebooks will now be available via the github navigation pane.

To work on your workshop materials:
1. Navigate to [http://colab.research.google.com/github](http://colab.research.google.com/github).
2. Click the "Include Private Repos" checkbox.
3. Navigate to your workshop repository and open the .ipynb file.
4. Add any code you wish. 
5. If you are signed into a Google Account you can save a copy to your Google Drive while you work (Ctrl+S).
6. When you are done working on a section, make sure to save a copy back onto GitHub (File, Save a Copy in GitHub).

__TODO__
- add in the screenshots.

#### Local Setup
You may however want to work on this project on your own machine. Below is a suggested local setup, although experienced students may want to create their own environment tailored to their preferences.

__TODO__
- Insert local setup notes.
