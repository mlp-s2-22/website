Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

### [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Piazza_logo.svg" width="75"/>](https://piazza.com/)

The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on Piazza. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. When you post a question on Piazza, you can choose to do so anonymously to your classmates. Note that the course instructors and tutors can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you’re providing great answers to others’ questions!

### Student hours

The weeks lecturer will each hold student hours on __[INSERT DATE/TIME]__. These will be __[in person at INSERT LOCATION/on Zoom LINK]__. Please feel free to call in with any questions, or just to say hi! If required, the course organiser is also available to meet by appointment, please email to request one.

### Email 

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Piazza or Teams), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, concessions).

### General Support

For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:

- Your personal tutor (especially if you are struggling in general)
